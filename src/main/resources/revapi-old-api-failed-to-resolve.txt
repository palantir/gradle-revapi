Failed to resolve old API, meaning revapi cannot use it to find API/ABI breaks. This usually happens when the last
release was git tagged correctly but the publish build was not successful. If this is the case, there are two options:

1) Ideally: Retrigger the publish build to ensure the API is published.
2) Otherwise: You can choose to target against a different version, ideally the last correctly published version. Either run:
     * ./gradlew {{versionOverrideTaskName}} --{{replacementVersionOption}} <version>
       to override for all projects
     * ./gradlew {{taskPath}} --{{replacementVersionOption}} <version>
       to override for just this project "{{projectDisplayName}}"
